	<h1> What is this map? </h1>
	<p>This map was created to help with tourism in Sao Paulo, Brazil. By including transportation, large tourist attractions, and smaller locations like restaurants, museums, parks, etc this map is comprehensive for all types of tourists.
	I have wanted to travel to Brazil for a while now so this was a good way for me to do research on what tourists do in the city and then also see some local places that are not tourist attractions. The 
	transportation routes that were chosen were chosen because of the ease of use and the popularity of each, which plays into part of the safety of the choice of transportation.</p>
	<h1>Cartographic Choices</h1>
	<p>The basemap for this one is a simple map that shows the streets and local area names. I chose this because tourists will want to see more
	information about the location they are in, like street names to help them travel aroung the area. Colors are simple as well, basic and default colors mostly.
	I chose to have the choice to look at transportation and places so the map does not get too cluttered with information.</p>
	<h1>New Leaflet Approach</h1>
	<p>With many attempts I tried using a custome marker to display the different types of points I have: restaurants, theaters, museums, and
	churches. This was to have easy visuals for the user without clicking on the point to get a name to figure out the purpose of the points. This had many difficulties with
	trying to get it to work. Still does not work, going to keep trying after turning in because this is bothering me and I want it to work.</p>
